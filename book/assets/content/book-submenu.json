This concept was conceived by the then British Team cycling coach Sir Dave Brailsford where the central tenet was to introduce, incrementally, improvements of 1% to all areas of the cycling team, from selection of pillows to paint on the trucks. It changed the mind sets of everyone who was involved at every level of the team where they were empowered to make these small, but significant, improvements. It was not about doing it all in one go, it was a strategic approach to achieving the cycling team’s goals. Think back to the requirements of a High Performing Team!  Above all else, it was a team effort.</p>",
